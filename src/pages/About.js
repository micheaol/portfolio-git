            I know how to work remotely and collaboratively because of the experience I have gained when learning to code at Microverse, an online training school. In this school, I code every day with other developers around the world and have learned the important skills of communication and teamwork.

                <p>
                I also know how to work to tight deadlines because I submit capstone projects every week and make sure I do not go past the deadline. I also know how to learn new languages quickly! I have already created some projects in React, Javascript, and HTML.

                On top of this, my previous experience as a customer service Lead taught me discipline and how to meet client expectations, work hard, and always put clients first.
